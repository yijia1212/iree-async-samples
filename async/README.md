# OpenXLA Async Compiler and Runtime

This project contains the compiler and runtime plugins enabling async execution. It builds on top of the
core IREE toolkit.

## Development setup

The project can be built either as part of IREE by manually specifying
plugin paths via `-DIREE_COMPILER_PLUGIN_PATHS`, or for development tailored
to NVIDIA GPUs specifically, can be built directly:

```
cmake -GNinja -B build/ -S . \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
    -DIREE_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON \
    -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
    -DIREE_ENABLE_LLD=ON

# Recommended:
# -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache
```
